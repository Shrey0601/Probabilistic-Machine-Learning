This is the Readme file for the third assignment of CS772: Probabilistic Machine Learning.

This zip file contains the Code for Problem 5 ( Part 1  and Part 2 ) of the assignment in the file named Problem5_Part1.ipynb Problem5_Part2.ipynb, respectively.

The plots drawn from the code are attached in the zip file with the naming convention:

For Problem 5 Part 1:
P5_Part1.png

For Problem 5 Part 2:
Samples:(y),Var:(z).png where (y) is the number of samples and (z) is the proposal variance for which the graph is plotted.

The plots and the results have also been attached in the pdf file submitted.

The required libraries have been imported in the first cell of the python notebook submitted, so kindly install them if they still need to be present.

They can be installed using the following: 
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy

The comments alongside every piece of code have been added to explain every step of the code.
